# Mapbox 

This is a new piece of technology that I discovered and want to begin using in upcoming projects. 

Mapbox is a web mapping library allows you to add a map to a web page and define the data it contains, its appearance, and a variety of functionality. Think of it like a toolbox filled with many different map-making tools that can be used together to build beautiful and interactive custom experiences.
